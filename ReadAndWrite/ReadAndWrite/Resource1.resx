    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Active Beauty Advisor
This term is used specifically as it relates to the Monthly Level Qualifications and currently is defined as a Beauty Advisor that has a monthly PV of 75 or greater during any one month of a three-month period.  Beauty Advisors who fail to meet the minimum requirement will lose their team and their account will be changed to Crush Insider status

Bonus
Additional payments to eligible and qualified Beauty Advisors based on their team performance during the month. Willing Beauty supports two different monthly bonus payouts - Unilevel Bonuses and Generational Bonuses.
Bonus Period
The Bonus Period defines the start date and end date for each bonus payout under the compensation plan (Unilevel Bonuses and Generational Bonuses). Willing Beauty Bonus Periods are defined as the first day of each month and ending on the last day of each month. 
Breakage
Breakage is considered any bonus that is left unpaid due to the failure of a Beauty Advisor to qualify for that type of bonus.
Clawback
Clawback is the ability to recapture commissions paid on an order when that order is returned. When an order is returned, the dollar amount paid to any upline or downline Beauty Advisor on that purchase is subtracted from the Beauty Advisors bonus payout the next time commissions are processed. 
Commissionable Volume (CV)
The CV is recognized as the wholesale price of a product that is purchased. CV and PV represent the same value.
Commissions
Payments are made in the form of Commissions to Beauty Advisors that are eligible and are made on a weekly basis. Willing Beauty currently supports a single weekly Commission payout.

The Willing Beauty Monthly Commissions Period is defined as starting on the first day of a given month and ending on the last day of that month
Compression
Compression is not used in any Unilevel Bonus or Generational Bonus calculations within the Willing Beauty compensation plan. This does not mean that if someone terminates, that the downline fails to roll up providing earnings one level higher within the plan. For Beauty Advisors, compression only occurs after termination. For Crush Insiders, Beauty Advisors in the first level of a Crush Insider roll up to the next highest Beauty Advisor if the Crush Insider does not convert to a Beauty Advisor within three months of when the downline Beauty Advisor becomes a Beauty Advisor

Beauty Advisors must meet the Personal Volume and Eligibility Timeframe guidelines in order to be considered eligible for Bonus and Commission payments. Currently, Beauty Advisors are considered Eligible if they have a cumulative PV of 75 once in a three month period 
Genealogy
This is the overall organizational structure that indicates how and where Beauty Advisors are placed. Willing Beauty supports a primary Unilevel Genealogy where placement and sponsorship may not be the same for all Beauty Advisors.

For Inherited Beauty Advisors that are placed at your Level 1 (Direct Beauty Advisor), you become their mentor just like Personally Sponsored Beauty Advisors. Inherited Beauty Advisors count for Team Structure qualification criteria but not for Personally Sponsored qualification criteria. 
Leg

Qualifications listed in multiple categories are what makes the basis for the Bonus payouts at the end of each Qualification period.
Paid-As Title
A Beauty Advisors Paid-As Title is the title at which he or she naturally qualifies, regardless of any Paid-As Title Exemption. If a Beauty Advisor has a Paid-As Title Exemption applied, but their Qualified Paid-As Title is higher than that which they are Exempt, the Beauty Advisors Paid-As Title takes precedence over the Paid-As Title Exemption. 
Personally Sponsored Beauty Advisor
A Personally Sponsored Beauty Advisor is someone a Beauty Advisor or Crush Insider has personally enrolled into one of the Origami Owl Family of Brands companies.
