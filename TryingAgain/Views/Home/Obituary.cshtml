    I had never had the pleasure of meeting Anthony, but I have served under his sister, Michelle Wright, as my supervisor. I'm sure he was a great person and I only heard great things from Michelle. You all are in my prayers. God bless you Michelle and the San Miguel family and friends.

    Siento mucho la pérdida del señor Miguel. Imagino el dolor que sienten sus familiares y amigos. Quisiera compartir con ustedes un mensaje de esperanza que hallamos en la palabra de Dios. En Isaias 25:8 Dios nos promete que muy pronto le pondrá fin a la muerte y acabará con todo lo que nos hace sufrir.
